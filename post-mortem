**Elias:**

Technical skills, personal:
I am happy and impressed by what I've learned during the course of this project.
I could have learned and practised more, however. So I'm a bit disappointed in myself, but only slightly.

Technical skills, everyone:
Thanks to this project, we now know a lot more about the steps and tasks that need to be done beforehand, in order to work more efficiently in later stages.
We learnt this the hard way.

Group dynamics, everyone:
We had a group crisis mid-project. However, the fact that everyone remained polite, constructive and respectful of each other, allowed us to move forward, get a fresh start, and keep improving the project.
The crisis did not kill the project. On the contrary.
Everyone had different levels of work put into the project, but this did not translate into hard feelings whatsoever.
I feel that everyone learnt a great deal in terms of group project management, both technically and socially :)
